##  Overview
**StatViz-ML-Gallery** is an interactive, multipage educational dashboard built to bridge the gap between high-level Machine Learning implementation and low-level Statistical Theory. 

Most ML courses teach you how to use `.fit()` and `.predict()`. This gallery focuses on the **internal mechanics**: decision boundaries, loss surfaces, residual patterns, and probability distributions. 



##  The Curriculum
The gallery is organized into a progressive learning path:

### 1. Supervised Learning (Regression & Classification)
* **Linear Regression:** Deep dive into OLS assumptions, Residuals vs. Fitted plots, and Heteroscedasticity.
* **Logistic Regression:** Visualizing the Sigmoid curve and comparing Frequentist (MLE) vs. Bayesian uncertainty clouds.
* **Decision Trees:** Understanding recursive partitioning and the impact of tree depth on overfitting.
* **Random Forest:** Visualizing variance reduction through the "Wisdom of Crowds" (Ensemble Bagging).
* **SVM:** Maximizing the margin and identifying the specific Support Vectors that define decision boundaries.
* **Naive Bayes:** Mapping posterior probability surfaces based on the assumption of feature independence.

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
* **K-Means Clustering:** Real-time visualization of Voronoi Tessellations and finding the "Elbow" in Inertia curves.
* **PCA:** Geometrical projection of 3D data clouds onto 2D Principal Components while maximizing variance retention.

### 3. Deep Learning
* **Neural Networks (MLP):** Visualizing how hidden layers and non-linear activations warp feature space to solve complex, non-linear problems.
